# Simple PHP Ping Checking Service

Pings a configured list of IPv4 addresses and alerts a list of notification email addresses if a ping fails.

## Setup

Very simple to setup using the `config.yml` which includes configurations for SMTP auth to send alert emails.

Application logs messages inside the `log/` folder. Logs rotate on a daily basis and may need a cleanup script added.

## Running

Should run on most linux servers with PHP installed (may need additional php-* packages - please submit an issue if you find required packages).

To run simply enter:

`php index.php`

To stop:

`ctrl + c`

To run in the background:

`nohup php index.php &`
